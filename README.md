# GDG LAGOS CLOUD EVENT

This is the AWS slide for the GDG Cloud event held at the CCHUB in Lagos, Nigeria.

## Setup
To set this up on your system, just run:

```git clone http://github.com/nanyaks/aws-slides.git```

The above command will give you a local copy of the project checked out to a directory in your system.

#### Note:
you must have git installed and working for the slides to be setup correctly.


## Dependencies
This repo contains the source of the awesome [reveal.js](http://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) slideshow library. Thanks Hakkem.

If you want to have the application installed with Grunt will also need to have grunt.js installed to build and run it with ( http://localhost:8000/ ) or you could optionally view the index.html file in your browser of choice ( any recent browser will do ) as the library uses some CSS 3 mojo and not all browsers will render correctly.

by all browsers, i believe you know i speak of internet explorer right? ;)
